# Indigo Slate Coding Challenge



## Development 

### Challenge Requirements

Use the video as a base to launch from, you do not need to match colors, recreate the logo, etc. You are also welcome to present an alternative to the classic Hamburger Menu. Also, please limit the use of Bootstrap or any other CSS framework while taking the challenge and make it fun. Be sure to account for the idea of a larger multi-tiered navigation!

We look forward to seeingâ€¦

1. Is it comfortable to interact with, does it feel well thought out?
2. How you have you made use of animations to enhance the experience
3. How did you approach the development (Code structure, creative solutions, complexity, etc)


### Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3/Bootstrap
3. Jquery 
4. Javascript
5. Keyframe/CSS Animations


### Approach Taken

I wanted to build a navigation menu that was made with mostly CSS to ensure accurate, timely functionality to create the best user experience possible.
I started with building out a small portion of the multi tiered navigation to test out it's animation and jquery functionality. 
Once I styled the navbar in the way I wanted, I continued to add the rest of the menu items and checked each one along the way.
With a little bit of Jquery, CSS Animations and Keyframe Animations, I coded smooth, timely transitions when opening each menu/submenu.
    

## What did I learn?

1. How to create a multi tier navigation without completely relying on a CSS Framework! It was a great experience learning how to style it and add in functionality without using strictly Javascript as well.
2. How to properly nest multiple menus inside of one another.
